## What is this project?

- This is a project for UNL CSCE 438 IOT. The intention is there are two components: the web component and the hardware component. The hardware component consists of two Arduino-based microcontrollers. These controllers handle GPS information. One is a dog collar and one is the "home base" that sends information back to Microsoft Azure. The web component handles user interaction and access to the mapping information and interface.
